# Microbus.io fabric : Milestone 1

## Introduction

`Microbus` is a framework for the development, deployment and operation of microservices in Go. Its most notable characteristic is that it leverages NATS, a messaging bus, for communications among microservices.

`fabric` is the main project that provides the core capabilities that all `Microbus` microservices require. Every milestone of this project will be released separately in order to demonstrate the thinking process behind the building of this framework. This is the first milestone.

## Documentation

The [Quick Start](docs/quick-start.md) will guide you through setting up your system and running the examples.

The [Code Overview](docs/code-overview.md) describes all packages in the project and is a good orientation of the code structure.

A technical [Deep Dive](docs/deep-dive.md) discusses in depth the technical aspects of the system.
