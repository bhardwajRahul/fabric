# Agent Rules

The rules file `.claude/rules/microbus.md` teaches a [coding agent](../blocks/coding-agents.md) the conventions and patterns of the `Microbus` framework. It is loaded automatically at the start of every agent session and serves as the agent's reference manual for how to write correct `Microbus` code. Where [skills](../blocks/agent-skills.md) tell the agent what to do, rules tell it how to do it.

The rules file is updated with each release of `Microbus` and should not be edited by hand.
