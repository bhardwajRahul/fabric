# Bootstrapping a New Microbus Project

Make a new directory to hold the files of your `Microbus`-based project.

```shell
mkdir -p myproject
cd myproject
```

Instruct your coding agent to:

> HEY CLAUDE...
>
> Follow the workflow at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microbus-io/fabric/refs/heads/main/setup/bootstrap.md to bootstrap Microbus.

The project is ready. [Create a microservice](../howto/create-microservice.md), rinse and repeat.
