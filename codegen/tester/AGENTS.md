**CRITICAL**: The instructions in this `AGENTS.md` file, if present, should only be applied when working on the microservice in the same directory, and should take precedence over instructions in the global `AGENTS.md` and `AGENTS-MICROBUS.md` files located at the root of the project. If you have not already read the global `AGENTS.md` or `AGENTS-MICROBUS.md` files, do so now.
