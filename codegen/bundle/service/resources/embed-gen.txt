/*
Files placed in the resources directory are bundled with the executable and are accessible via svc.ResFS or
any of the convenience methods svc.ReadResFile, svc.ReadResTextFile, svc.ExecuteResTemplate, svc.ServeResFile, etc.

A file named text.yaml can be used to store localized strings that can be loaded via svc.LoadResString to best match
the locale of the context. The YAML should map a string key to its localized values on a per language basis:

Localized:
  en: Localized
  en-GB: Localised
  fr: Localisée
  it: Localizzato
  default: Localized

If a default language is not explicitly provided, English (en) is used as the fallback language.
String keys and ISO 639 language codes are case sensitive.
