/*
Package rand is a utility that combines crypto.rand and math.rand for more secure random number generation with
reduced performance impact.
The package keeps a pool of math generators, making it unlikely that two consecutive random numbers are
generated by the same math generator.
It also reseeds the math generators occassionally using a seed generated by a crypto generator.
